# Remote sensed data

![right500:](Fig/DINEOF2_1.png)

* generally __more accurate than models__
* good __spatial coverage__

But:
* __gaps__ due to e.g. clouds
* just the __surface__
* just __some parameters__ (temperature, sea surface height, salinity, ...)
* no prediction (obviously)

---
# Application to SST

*  Having __long time series__ to train neural networks is quite important
*  Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) dataset, from 1 April 1985 to 31 December 2009.
*  One single image is composed by 112 x 112 grid points.
*  __Cross-validation__: in the last 50 images we removed data according to the cloud mask of the first 50 images of the SST time series.
     * not used at all during either the training or the reconstruction phases
     * can be considered independent.
     * 106816 measurements have been withheld this way.

---
# Study area
![right500:](Fig/fig01-plotregion-arrow.png)
* the red rectangle: delimits the studied region
* color represents the bathymetry in meters
* the main currents: the Western Corsican Current (WCC), the Eastern Corsican Current (ECC) and the Northern Corsican Current (NC)


---
# Bayes rule
![right450:](Fig/plot_bayes_rule.svg)

* For Gaussian-distributed errors:
   * prior: $N(x^f,\sigma^f)$
   * observations: $N(y^o,\sigma^o)$
   * posterior: $N(x^a,\sigma^a)$
* Bayes:

$$
p(x|y^o) = \frac{p(x) p(y^o|x) }{p(y^o)}
$$

* Mean and variance of posterior given by:
$$\begin{eqnarray}
{\sigma^a}^{-2} x^a &=&
{\sigma^f}^{-2} x^f +
{\sigma^o}^{-2} y^o  \\\\
{\sigma^a}^{-2}  &=&
{\sigma^f}^{-2}  +
{\sigma^o}^{-2}  \\\\
\end{eqnarray}$$

* Concept of __information__: ${\sigma^f}^{-2} x^f$ and ${\sigma^o}^{-2} y^o$

---
# Neural network with missing data as input

* The handling of missing data is done in analogy to the assimilation of data in numerical ocean models.
* The standard optimal interpolation equations can be written as follows:

$$\begin{eqnarray}
{\mat P^a}^{-1} \vec x^a &=&
{\mat P^f}^{-1} \vec x^f +
{\mat H}^T {\mat R}^{-1} \vec y^o  \\\\
{\mat P^a}^{-1} &=&
{\mat P^f}^{-1} +
{\mat H}^T {\mat R}^{-1} \mat H
\end{eqnarray}$$

where $\vec x^f$ is the model forecast with error covariance $\mat P^f$, $\vec y^o$ are the observations with error covariance $\mat R$ and $\mat H$ is the observation operator extracting the observed part from the state vector $\vec x^f$.
* The analysis $\vec x^a$ is the combined estimate with the error covariance matrix $\mat P^a$.
* The main input datasets of the CAE are i) the SST divided by its error variance and ii) the inverse of the error variance.
* If a data point is missing, then the corresponding error variance is considered infinitely large and the value at this point would be zero for both input datasets.

---
# Structure

The total list of input parameters is consequently the following:

*  __SST anomalies__ scaled by the __inverse of the error variance__ (zero if the data is missing)
*  __Inverse of the error variance__ (zero if the data is missing)
*  Scaled SST anomalies and inverse of error variance of the __previous day__
*  Scaled SST anomalies and inverse of error variance of the __next day__
*  __Longitude__ (scaled linearly between -1 and 1)
*  __Latitude__ (scaled linearly between -1 and 1)
*  cosinus and sinus of the __day of the year__ divided by 365.25

The complete dataset is thus represented by an array of the size 10 x 112 x 112 x 5266.
The inverse of the error variance is either zero (for missing data) or a constant.

# Output of the neural network

The final layer of the neural network produces the following output:

*  __SST__ scaled by the inverse of the expected error variance
*  Logarithm of the inverse of the __expected error variance__


*  The main building blocks of the neural network are __convolutional layers__.
*  DINCAE uses 5 encoding and 5 decoding layers with a different number of filter sizes.
*  Beside the input and output layer, the filter sizes are 16, 24, 36 and 54
*  We also added __skip connections__ between the output of pooling layers and the upsampling layers (concatenation).
*  The motivation of this choice is that large-scale information of the SST would be captured by the neurons in the bottle-neck, but small-scale structures unrelated to the overall structure in the SST would be handled by these skip connections. In the absence of the skip connections, the small scale structures would be removed from the dataset.


---
# Structure
![right800:](Fig/slide_network.svg)

---
# Training

* Partitioned into so-called mini-batches of 50 images
* The entire dataset are used multiple times (epoch)
* For every input image, more data points were masked (in addition to the cross-validation) by using a randomly chosen cloud mask during training (data set __augmentation__).
* The output of the neural network (for every single grid point $i,j$) is a Gaussian probability distribution function characterized by a mean $\hat y\_{ij}$ and a standard deviation $\hat \sigma\_{ij}$.
$$
\begin{equation}
  J(\hat y\_{ij}, \hat \sigma\_{ij}) = \frac{1}{2N} \sum\_{ij} \left[ \left( \frac{y\_{ij} - \hat y\_{ij}}{\hat \sigma\_{ij}} \right)^2 + \log (\hat \sigma\_{ij}^2 ) + 2\log(\sqrt{2\pi} ) \right]
\end{equation}
$$

* The first term: mean square error, but scaled by the estimated error standard deviation.
* The second term: penalizes any over-estimation of the error standard deviation.

---
# Optimization

* Adam optimizer with the standard parameters for the learning rate $\alpha = 0.001$, the exponential decay rate for the first moment estimates $\beta\_1 = 0.9$, and for the second-moment estimates $\beta\_1 = 0.999$, regularization parameter $\epsilon=10^{-8}$.
* Avoid overfitting
    * drop-out layer between the fully connected layers of the network.
    * Gaussian-distributed noise to the input of the network with a zero mean and a standard deviation of 0.05°C.

---
# Results


![right500:](Fig/fig03-RMS_iterations.svg)
* RMS difference with cross-validation dataset as a function of iteration.
* The solid blue line represents the DINCAE reconstruction at different steps of the iterative minimization algorithm.
* The dashed cyan line is the DINEOF reconstruction and the dashed red line is the __average DINCAE reconstruction__ between epochs 200 and 1000.

---
# Error estimation
![right500:](Fig/fig04-data-avg-scatter-err.png)
* scatter plot of the true SST (withheld during cross-validation) and the corresponding reconstructed SST.
* The color represents the estimated expected error standard deviation of the reconstruction.
* Low error values are expected to be closer to the dashed line.
* Reconstructed and cross-validation SST tend to cluster relatively well around the ideal dashed line.
* Typically the lower expected errors are found more often near the dashed line than at the edge of the cluster of points.



---
# Error estimation
![right500:](Fig/fig05-data-avg-pdf-err.svg)
* Scaled errors are computed as the difference between the reconstructed SST and the actual measured SST (withheld during cross-validation) divided by the expected standard deviation error.

# Conclusions

* __Practical way to handle missing data__ in satellite images for neural networks
* Measured data __divided by its expected error variance__. Missing data are thus treated as data with an infinitely large error variance.
* The cost function of the neural network is chosen such that the network provides the reconstruction but also the __confidence of the reconstruction error__
* Reconstruction method __DINCAE compared favourably__ to the widely used DINEOF reconstruction method which is based on a truncated EOF analysis
* The expected error for the reconstruction reflects well the __areas covered by the satellite measurements__ as well as the areas with more intrinsic variability (like meanders of the Northern Current). The expected error predicted by the neural network provides a good indication of the accuracy of the reconstruction.
* The variability of the DINCAE reconstruction __matched the variability of the original data__ relatively well.

# Perceptron

![right300:](Fig/Frank_Rosenblatt.jpg)
Frank Rosenblatt with a Mark I Perceptron computer in 1960

* Single layer (perceptron)

$$
\mathbf x\_1 = f(\mathbf W\_0 \mathbf x\_0 + \mathbf b\_0)
$$


$\mat W_0$ denotes the matrix of weights, $\mathbf x$ is the vector of inputs, $\mathbf b$ is the bias and $f$ is the non-linear activation function.

 ...and you thought debugging is hard!

---
# Multi-layer perceptron

* fully connected layer
![right300:](Fig/Artificial_neural_network.svg)

$$
\mathbf x\_n = f(\mathbf W\_n \mathbf x\_{n-1} + \mathbf b\_n)
$$

* 1989: George Cybenko: universal approximation theorem states:
  * Feed-forward network with a single hidden layer
  * Finite number of neurons can approximate continuous functions on compact subsets of $ℝ^n$
  * [Visual "proof"](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html)

* However... It turns out that __deep__ networks network are much more powerful than __wide__ network
---
# Activation functions
![right800:](Fig/activation_function.png)

* Importance: activation function must be non-linear
* Fun fact: even the [rounding error from floating number](https://openai.com/blog/nonlinear-computation-in-linear-networks/) act as a non-linearity that can be used to to make a neural network.

---
# Convolutional neural network
![right800:](Fig/Typical_cnn.png)

---
# Convolutional layer
![right500:](Fig/conv-layer.gif)
*  Takes a 3D array (lines, columns, number of input channel) and produces a 3D array (lines, columns, number of output channel)
  *  The two first dimensions are typically spatial dimensions
  *  The spatial resolution is essentially maintained
  *  Weighted sum over a small subset of an image (typically 3 x 3, 5 x 5)
*  Several weighted sums with different weights are computed

---
# Pooling layer

![right800:](Fig/pooling.png)
* maximum or average of a subset (typicalll 2x2), resolution is spatial resolution significantly reduced (typically by a factor of 4).
* Convolutional layers, pooling layers and fully connected layers can be combined (after flatting the dimensions of the 3D array into a vector).

# Cost/loss functions
![right300:](Fig/cost_function.png)
* The ouput of the neural network should satisfy a priori range constraints
    * in particular: no negative probabilities, sum of all probabilities should be 1 by using e.g. [softmax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function)
* __Regression__: output is a continous parameter
     * mean square error,...
* __Classification__: output is a class label
     * last layer provides the probability for each class label
     * cross-entropy, negative log likelihood


---
# Autoencoder
![right500:](Fig/caearch_shallow.png)
* Neural network is trained to produce as output the same as the input
* Information is compressed in the so called bottle-neck

# Digital information
*  Letters → numbers (e.g. A is 65 in the ASCII table, 🎂 is unicode number 127874)
*  Text (words, paragraph, books) → Vector of numbers
*  Color → 3 numbers (red, green blue fractions)
*  Image → Matrix of colors or 3D-array
*  Sound → Vector (air pressure varying in time)
*  Temperature field in the ocean → 4D-array

# Digital information
*  Different representations are not unique
*  Assume there are 3 categories: cat, dog, bird. One can give them the numbers 1,2 and 3 or the vectors [1,0,0], [0,1,0] and [0,0,1]
*  The later representation is called one-hot-encoding and is generally preferred for categorial variables
